# The Dev Workflow
Today we will be focusing on how to approach the development workflow. We want to share with you strategies and tools to help you tackle programmer's daily challenges. 

## Key topics for today
1. How to make the most out of your time on the bootcamp
2. Recap on the curriculum
3. Developer's daily life
4. Incremental approach in programming 
5. Github workflow

## Important to remember: 

- Every question is welcomed. Remember that your question might not be only yours. By asking your question, you help the group
- To interact, you can either type on the chat or open your mic and talk
- Do not compare your learning process with others. Rather, observe how today you know more than you knew yesterday and create your own baseline

## How to make the most of the lectures
- During the live coding sessions make sure you follow along and do not get hung up on trying to code along. Use this time to pay attention on the code being shared and make sure to ask your questions 
- If during the live code session I	share any methods or terms that you would like to research more about it, make a note and research later. If start your research in the middle of the lecture you may loose other important parts of the explanation
- To become more familiar with the markdown language, we recommend that you take notes using markdown. You can try a few markdown editors to help you understanding the structure, such as [this](https://stackedit.io/app#).
- In compass you will have a lot of exercises to practise on your own. If you are stuck for more than 15 minutes make sure to request the mentor's assistance
